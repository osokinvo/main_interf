In this project, images of oxide films of different thicknesses were modulated by changing the reflection coefficients at the air-oxide and oxide-metal interfaces.
The model is based on the sensitivity of the color-sensitive sensors of the human eye. A table of sensitivity measurements is provided, but the following standards were used: 'Wright & Guild 1931 2 Degree RGB CMFs'.
The model showed why it is impossible to see bright colors on thick films. This occurs due to the large number of intensity peaks in the visible spectrum, all three sensors of the eye are excited and the color is perceived as gray. There is an image of a graph of one of the gray colors of a thick film of the dependence of light intensity on wavelength.
The resulting color combinations were not detected on samples of the oxide film of stainless steel and titanium.
The assumption about the influence of the color of the oxide itself on the color of the film is partially correct.
If the color of the oxide was the same at any thickness, then there would be no color gradient observed.
This means that the color of the oxide also changes with changes in thickness, then it is possible to obtain different color combinations, which explains the practical results of stainless steel and titanium oxides.
